        <p>He wasnt wearing a breach cloth---he didnt have war
            paint all over his face---his straight black hair was short
            and he was carrying a suitcase instead of a bow and
            arrow. His stocky frame was not picturesque; however,
            he did have a fierce look in his beady black
            eyes---or did an eight year old girl imagine that? His
            skin though not red red was a satisfyingly dark color,
            and he instilled a feeling of awe in me.</p>
        <p>Later we were all to look back with wonder at the events
            that transpired in the next fifteen months. its
            unbelievable, said my older sister last week. no one but
            Papa and Mama would have allowed a stranger to stay
            so long in their home, treat him as part of the family and
            charge him nothing.</p>
        <p>Mama and Papa never had much money but we were
            rich in the important things in life. Mama was a cute
            little redhead with a wonderful sense of humor. Papa
            was a well read school teacher with a twinkle in his
            
            eyes. they both had a deep and abiding faith in god and
            were always ready to help others. according to Papa the
            more you put into life---the more you get back. one of
            his favorite quotes ends---and in parting leave behind
            you footprints on the sands of time.</p>
        <p>We lived in the hills of Arkansas on top of Brock
            mountain, just 1\4 mile off state highway 25. during the
            depression years tramps walked the unpaved dusty
            highways in search of a place to work and live. Often
            they came to our house, clearly visible from the
            highway, and asked for food and a place to sleep. Papa
            never turned anyone away and our doors were never
            locked. If there were keys for the locks, I never saw
            them. if they asked to work for food, Papa would let
            them chop some wood for the wood cook stove. if they
            did not offer to work Papa fed them anyway. He let
            them seep in the hay loft in the barn. there were no
            extra rooms in the house or he would probably have put
            them there.</p>
        <p>Grandma Massey lived with us. she was well along in
            years and was always searching for the proverbial
            fountain of youth, or at any rate a cure for her aches and
            pains. grandmas friend, Alice Bullard, told her about
            this eighty year old Indian Doctor Flying Cloud who had
            wandered through the country to locust grove, Arkansas.</p>
        <p>According to Mrs. Bullard this doctor, who was also a
            Methodist preacher, was performing healing miracles
            everywhere he went. at grandmas request Papa drove
            down the mountain and asked DR flying cloud to come
            and treat grandmas ailments.</p>
        <p>He moved into our house bag and baggage---and stayed
            fifteen months. He even sent for his nephew, Willie, to
            come and stay with him in our house. He made himself
            completely at home and doctored our family along with
            everyone in the neighborhood. occasionally he stayed a
            few days with someone else but he considered our
            house to be his home.</p>
        <p>He believed in ghosts to us---spirits to him. he sat
            around the fireplace with we three kids and our friends.
            while we roasted peanuts and popped corn he told us the
            most fascinating ghost stories I ever heard. they were
            deliciously frightening and entertained the lot of us
            many a long winter night. they were also the basis for
            some pretty wild dreams---the most frightening ones
            had to do with people being buried alive. I still have a
            phobia about that!</p>
        <p>Eugene, Evelyn and I grew quite fond of DR flying
            cloud and I believe he liked us too. he insisted we call
            him grandpa which I for one was a little reluctant to do.
            I felt that name was only for grandpa Jackson.</p>
        <p>Though he did like me, he was responsible for my being
            punished once. you see---I still believe it was his fault
            after all these years. Papa grew some very good
            watermelons we three kids helped to cultivate and
            harvest. We stored them in the underground
            storm cellar.</p>
        <p>There was an exceptionally large melon I wanted very
            much to eat. Doctor Flying Cloud said we must save it
            for a special time, which he would choose, and we must
            save the seeds. one afternoon carol and faith Thomas
            came to visit Evelyn and I. Mama said carol and Evelyn
            could choose a watermelon and faith and I
            could choose a watermelon. I asked, may we choose any
            melon we want to eat? Mama said, yes. of course I
            took the big one! we did save the seeds and what we
            could not eat we shared with everyone else.</p>
        <p>Doctor flying cloud was very angry with me. he told
            Mama I should be punished because I knew the melon
            belonged to him. Mama told me to apologize but I
            refused to say I was sorry. she took a peach tree limb
            and switched my bare legs. I still refused to apologize.
            she finally gave up on me. I resented DR flying clouds
            attitude very much. later my mother said she should not
            have punished me. it really wasnt his melon and he had
            no right to boss us around.</p>
        <p>for instance the incident at the pine grove. there was a
            large grove of pine trees down in our pasture near the
            watermelon patch. the limbs grew low to the ground
            and the thick pine needles gave one a sense of privacy
            in the shelter of the trees. during the hot summer we
            played in the pine grove much of the time we had free
            from the farm work.</p>
        <p>Doctor Flying Cloud also liked to go to the pine grove.
            he gave us strict orders not to come near the grove while
            he was there.</p>
        <p>One afternoon we children had been down to the creek
            swimming. as we were nearing the pine grove on our
            path to the house we heard this peculiar noise coming
            from the grove. naturally curiosity got the best of us
            and we walked under the trees to see what was going
            on.</p>
        <p>Doctor Flying Cloud was bent over at the waist, waving
            his arms, dancing around in a large circle and shouting
            what sounded like hoe-kay-hee, hoe-kay-hee over and
            over again. when he faced our direction he saw us
            standing there.</p>
        <p>he was furious!! he told us we had broken a taboo. he
            was doing his war dance and war whoop and no white
            person was ever supposed to see or hear. we had
            desecrated a sacred ritual and would be very lucky
            indeed if nothing bad happened to us as a result of our
            naughty behavior.</p>
        <p>he accused us of following him to spy on him. he asked
            Mama and Papa to see that we didnt follow him again.
            by that time we didnt even want to know any more
            about what he did in the pine grove.</p>
        <p>Doctor Flying Cloud told us he was a protégé of the
            Roosevelt family. he said he was a frequent visitor in
            their home. I often dangled teddy on my knee when he
            was growing up, said Doctor Flying Cloud. he told us the
            Roosevelts put him through school and were responsible
            for his being so well educated.</p>
        <p>I dont know which school he attended---just that it was
            back east somewhere. he was a full fledged doctor of
            the homeopathic school. at that time there were two
            schools of medicine--the homeopathic and the
            allopathic. later, about 1900, the etstic school of
            medicine combined the good qualities of both schools.
        <p>Doctor Flying Cloud was also a doctor of chiropractic
            medicine. he convinced Mama she should allow him to
            cure her headache. they moved everything off the long
            oak harvest table in the kitchen and he had Mama lie
            down on her stomach on the table. I dont know if he
            could have cured her headache or not. she allowed him
            to take about two whacks on her back---then she jumped
            off that table madder than and old wet hen! I heard him
            say, come back here! Im not through. oh yes, you are!
            said Mama. she told him in no uncertain terms what she
            thought of that kind of doctoring. she said she would
            take his pills, but no more adjustments. I was sitting in
            the porch swing on the long back porch and heard the
            whole thing. she stalked by me muttering, that crazy
            fool would kill you if you let him.</p>
        <p>Those pills were something else! my brother had an
            extremely bad case of tonsillitis. he gargled with two of
            those little yellow pills Doctor Flying Cloud gave him.
            the next morning his temperature was gone and so was
            the sore throat.</p>
        <p>I dont know what drug was in those pills but I still
            remember the taste. it was like nothing I had ever tasted
            before or since. after I was married and had the three
            children I had a bad sore throat. I asked the doctor if
            my tonsils were the cause. He said, no, you have had
            your tonsils removed. I told him I had never had
            surgery. he said, well, you have no tonsils. they must
            have rotted out! I think those lousy little yellow pills
            burned them out. I know they burned my throat like fire
            when I had to gargle them. none of us, cousins, aunts,
            uncles etc. were allowed to escape those pills. we all
            got well, either because of or in spite of his treatments.
            When I felt ill, I did my utmost to keep him from
            knowing.</p>
        <p>I was anything but enthusiastic about being
            doctored by Doctor Flying Cloud, but I sure liked to watch
            him eat fish! I still have trouble believing anyone can
            eat fish like he did. He always wanted a glass of sweet milk, a
            glass of buttermilk, a glass of water and a cup of coffee
            around his plate. he would feed one of those bony little
            creek perch into the right side of his mouth and the
            bones would roll out the left side. I was totally
            enthralled. grandma Massey caught me staring in
            amazement and took me to task for being rude.</p>
        <p>One afternoon Doctor Flying Cloud opened one of
            his mysterious black suitcases. he said he wanted us to
            see one of his most prized possessions. he lifted out the
            most beautiful feathered Indian war bonnet. there were
            feathers worked into a beaded band all around the face
            and a long streamer of feathers down the back. I was
            awed at the sight of it. when he placed it on my head I
            was truly delighted. I strutted around before the mirror
            with those back feathers almost brushing the back of my
            knees as he told us the story.</p>
        <p>This beautiful feathered relic was sitting bulls war
            bonnet---the one he wore during Custers last stand.
            sitting bull was Doctor Flying Clouds uncle. though
            Doctor Flying Cloud was just fourteen years old and too
            young to be a warrior, he along with the entire tribe was
            present during the battle of custers last stand. he did not
            tell us any particulars about the fighting---he just said,
            the Indians won that one.</p>
        <p>I was skeptical about his being sitting bulls nephew. he
            had told us so many ghost stories--and I didnt really
            believe any of them. like Papa said, Doctor flying cloud
            admitted he had never actually seen a ghost, he just
            knew they were for real. now here was something right
            out of the history book! I guess I sort of classed it
            along with the other stories and didnt ask too many
            questions.</p>
        <p>I regret that attitude of mine to this day. years after
            Doctor Flying Cloud had gone on his way, I discovered
            this story was true. he, wearing the war bonnet, was
            pictured with some Washington dignitaries in my high
            school government text book. the accompanying
            caption stated flying cloud was sitting bulls nephew and
            this was indeed sitting bulls war bonnet. Someone
            smarter than I believed him!</p>
        <p>So who knows? I may yet meet some of Doctor Flying
            Clouds spirits I didnt believe were for real either!</p>
        <p>These are the combined rememberances of Eugene Ritter, Evelyin
            Massengill and Floy Brent
            Dr Flying cloud joined our family in 1934 in the Massey house @ almond, ar.
