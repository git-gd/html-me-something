                <p>The following historical account was previously recorded by:<br>

                    In collaboration with:<br>
                    <br>Eugene Ritter

                <p>He wasn't wearing a breach cloth --- he didn't have war
                    paint all over his face --- his straight black hair was short
                    and he was carrying a suitcase instead of a bow and
                    arrow. His stocky frame was not picturesque; however,
                    he did have a fierce look in his beady black
                    eyes --- or did an eight year old girl imagine that? His
                    skin though not red was a satisfyingly dark color,
                    and he instilled a feeling of awe in me.</p>
                <p>Later we were all to look back with wonder at the events
                    that transpired in the next fifteen months. Its
                    unbelievable, said my older sister last week. No one but
                    Papa and Mama would have allowed a stranger to stay
                    so long in their home, treat him as part of the family and
                    charge him nothing.</p>
                <p>Mama and Papa never had much money but we were
                    rich in the important things in life. Mama was a cute
                    little redhead with a wonderful sense of humor. Papa
                    was a well read school teacher with a twinkle in his
                    eyes. They both had a deep and abiding faith in god and
                    were always ready to help others. According to Papa the
                    more you put into life --- the more you get back. One of
                    his favorite quotes ends --- and in parting leave behind
                    you footprints on the sands of time.</p>
                <p>We lived in the hills of Arkansas on top of Brock
                    mountain, just 1\4 mile off state highway 25. During the
                    depression years tramps walked the unpaved dusty
                    highways in search of a place to work and live. Often
                    they came to our house, clearly visible from the
                    highway, and asked for food and a place to sleep. Papa
                    never turned anyone away and our doors were never
                    locked. If there were keys for the locks, I never saw
                    them. If they asked to work for food, Papa would let
                    them chop some wood for the wood cook stove. If they
                    did not offer to work Papa fed them anyway. He let
                    them seep in the hay loft in the barn. There were no
                    extra rooms in the house or he would probably have put
                    them there.</p>
                <p>Grandma Massey lived with us. She was well along in
                    years and was always searching for the proverbial
                    fountain of youth, or at any rate a cure for her aches and
                    pains. Grandma's friend, Alice Bullard, told her about
                    this eighty year old Indian Doctor Flying Cloud who had
                    wandered through the country to Locust Grove, Arkansas.
                    According to Mrs. Bullard this doctor, who was also a
                    Methodist preacher, was performing healing miracles
                    everywhere he went. At Grandma's request Papa drove
                    down the mountain and asked Doctor Flying Cloud to come
                    and treat Grandma's ailments.</p>
                <p>He moved into our house bag and baggage --- and stayed
                    fifteen months. He even sent for his nephew, Willie, to
                    come and stay with him in our house. He made himself
                    completely at home and doctored our family along with
                    everyone in the neighborhood. Occasionally he stayed a
                    few days with someone else but he considered our
                    house to be his home.</p>
                <p>He believed in ghosts to us --- spirits to him. He sat
                    around the fireplace with we three kids and our friends.
                    While we roasted peanuts and popped corn he told us the
                    most fascinating ghost stories I ever heard. They were
                    deliciously frightening and entertained the lot of us
                    many a long winter night. They were also the basis for
                    some pretty wild dreams --- the most frightening ones
                    had to do with people being buried alive. I still have a
                    phobia about that!</p>
                <p>Eugene, Evelyn and I grew quite fond of Doctor Flying
                    Cloud and I believe he liked us too. He insisted we call
                    him Grandpa which I for one was a little reluctant to do.
                    I felt that name was only for grandpa Jackson.
                    Though he did like me, he was responsible for my being
                    punished once. You see --- I still believe it was his fault
                    after all these years.</p>
                <p>Papa grew some very good
                    watermelons we three kids helped to cultivate and
                    harvest. We stored them in the underground
                    storm cellar.
                    There was an exceptionally large melon I wanted very
                    much to eat. Doctor Flying Cloud said we must save it
                    for a special time, which he would choose, and we must
                    save the seeds. One afternoon Carol and Faith Thomas
                    came to visit Evelyn and I. Mama said Carol and Evelyn
                    could choose a watermelon and Faith and I
                    could choose a watermelon. I asked, may we choose any
                    melon we want to eat? Mama said, yes. Of course I
                    took the big one! We did save the seeds and what we
                    could not eat we shared with everyone else.</p>
                <p>Doctor Flying Cloud was very angry with me. He told
                    Mama I should be punished because I knew the melon
                    belonged to him. Mama told me to apologize but I
                    refused to say I was sorry. She took a peach tree limb
                    and switched my bare legs. I still refused to apologize.
                    she finally gave up on me. I resented Doctor Flying Cloud's
                    attitude very much. Later my mother said she should not
                    have punished me. It really wasn't his melon and he had
                    no right to boss us around.</p>
                <p>For instance, the incident at the pine grove --- there was a
                    large grove of pine trees down in our pasture near the
                    watermelon patch. The limbs grew low to the ground
                    and the thick pine needles gave one a sense of privacy
                    in the shelter of the trees. During the hot summer we
                    played in the pine grove much of the time we had free
                    from the farm work.
                    Doctor Flying Cloud also liked to go to the pine grove.
                    He gave us strict orders not to come near the grove while
                    he was there.</p>
                <p>One afternoon we children had been down to the creek
                    swimming. As we were nearing the pine grove on our
                    path to the house we heard this peculiar noise coming
                    from the grove. Naturally curiosity got the best of us
                    and we walked under the trees to see what was going
                    on.
                    Doctor Flying Cloud was bent over at the waist, waving
                    his arms, dancing around in a large circle and shouting
                    what sounded like hoe-kay-hee, hoe-kay-hee over and
                    over again. When he faced our direction he saw us
                    standing there.</p>
                <p>He was furious!! he told us we had broken a taboo. He
                    was doing his war dance and war whoop and no white
                    person was ever supposed to see or hear. We had
                    desecrated a sacred ritual and would be very lucky
                    indeed if nothing bad happened to us as a result of our
                    naughty behavior.
                    He accused us of following him to spy on him. He asked
                    Mama and Papa to see that we didn't follow him again.
                    By that time we didn't even want to know any more
                    about what he did in the pine grove.</p>
                <p>Doctor Flying Cloud told us he was a protégé of the
                    Roosevelt family. He said he was a frequent visitor in
                    their home. "I often dangled Teddy on my knee when he
                    was growing up," said Doctor Flying Cloud. He told us the
                    Roosevelts put him through school and were responsible
                    for his being so well educated.
                    I don't know which school he attended --- just that it was
                    back east somewhere. He was a full fledged doctor of
                    the homeopathic school. At that time there were two
                    schools of medicine--the homeopathic and the
                    allopathic. Later, about 1900, the etstic school of
                    medicine combined the good qualities of both schools.
                <p>Doctor Flying Cloud was also a doctor of chiropractic
                    medicine. He convinced Mama she should allow him to
                    cure her headache. They moved everything off the long
                    oak harvest table in the kitchen and he had Mama lie
                    down on her stomach on the table. I don't know if he
                    could have cured her headache or not. She allowed him
                    to take about two whacks on her back --- then she jumped
                    off that table madder than and old wet hen! I heard him
                    say, come back here! Im not through. Oh yes, you are!
                    said Mama. She told him in no uncertain terms what she
                    thought of that kind of doctoring. She said she would
                    take his pills, but no more adjustments. I was sitting in
                    the porch swing on the long back porch and heard the
                    whole thing. She stalked by me muttering, that crazy
                    fool would kill you if you let him.</p>
                <p>Those pills were something else! my brother had an
                    extremely bad case of tonsillitis. He gargled with two of
                    those little yellow pills Doctor Flying Cloud gave him.
                    The next morning his temperature was gone and so was
                    the sore throat.
                    I don't know what drug was in those pills but I still
                    remember the taste. It was like nothing I had ever tasted
                    before or since.</p>
                <p>Sometime after I was married, after having all three
                    of my children, I had a bad sore throat. I asked the doctor if
                    my tonsils were the cause. He said, no, you have had
                    your tonsils removed. I told him I had never had
                    surgery. He said, well, you have no tonsils. They must
                    have rotted out! I think those lousy little yellow pills
                    burned them out. I know they burned my throat like fire
                    when I had to gargle them. None of us, cousins, aunts,
                    uncles etc. were allowed to escape those pills. We all
                    got well, either because of or in spite of his treatments.
                    When I felt ill, I did my utmost to keep him from
                    knowing.</p>
                <p>I was anything but enthusiastic about being
                    doctored by Doctor Flying Cloud, but I sure liked to watch
                    him eat fish! I still have trouble believing anyone can
                    eat fish like he did. He always wanted a glass of sweet milk, a
                    glass of buttermilk, a glass of water and a cup of coffee
                    around his plate. He would feed one of those bony little
                    creek perch into the right side of his mouth and the
                    bones would roll out the left side. I was totally
                    enthralled. Grandma Massey caught me staring in
                    amazement and took me to task for being rude.</p>
                <p>One afternoon Doctor Flying Cloud opened one of
                    his mysterious black suitcases. He said he wanted us to
                    see one of his most prized possessions. He lifted out the
                    most beautiful feathered Indian war bonnet. There were
                    feathers worked into a beaded band all around the face
                    and a long streamer of feathers down the back. I was
                    awed at the sight of it. When he placed it on my head I
                    was truly delighted. I strutted around before the mirror
                    with those back feathers almost brushing the back of my
                    knees as he told us the story.
                    This beautiful feathered relic was Sitting Bull's war
                    bonnet --- the one he wore during Custer's Last Stand.</p>
                <p>Sitting Bull was Doctor Flying Cloud's uncle. Though
                    Doctor Flying Cloud was just fourteen years old and too
                    young to be a warrior, he along with the entire tribe was
                    present during the battle of Custer's Last Stand. He did not
                    tell us any particulars about the fighting --- he just said,
                    the Indians won that one.</p>
                <p>I was skeptical about his being Sitting Bull's nephew. He
                    had told us so many ghost stories--and I didn't really
                    believe any of them. Like Papa said, Doctor flying cloud
                    admitted he had never actually seen a ghost, he just
                    knew they were for real. Now here was something right
                    out of the history book! I guess I sort of classed it
                    along with the other stories and didn't ask too many
                    questions. I regret that attitude of mine to this day.</p>
                <p> Years after Doctor Flying Cloud had gone on his way, I discovered
                    this story was true. He, wearing the war bonnet, was
                    pictured with some Washington dignitaries in my high
                    school government text book. The accompanying
                    caption stated Flying Cloud was Sitting Bull's nephew and
                    this was indeed Sitting Bull's war bonnet. Someone
                    smarter than I believed him!
                    So who knows? I may yet meet some of Doctor Flying
                    Cloud's spirits I didn't believe were for real either!</p>
                <p>These are the combined rememberances of Eugene Ritter, Evelyn Massengill (Ritter) and Floy Brent (Ritter).<br><br>
                    Doctor Flying Cloud joined our family in 1934 in the Massey house @ Almond, AR.
